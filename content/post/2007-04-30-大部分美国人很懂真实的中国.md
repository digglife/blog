[][1][][2]今天在digg上看到<a target="_blank" href="http://www.zonaeuropa.com/20041223_1.htm">一个被Digg 2000多次的网页</a>.标题是<a target="_blank" href="http://digg.com/world_news/The_Real_China_Pics_2">真实的中国(The Real China)</a>,这个网页用照片的形式表现了中国的贫穷落后和极其的不人道.这些照片即便是中国人看过之后都会觉得震惊或者悲哀,更何况是能够在家里悠闲地Digging的美国人.但是我在上面看到的评论却很少以一种狭隘和片面的观点来看待这些照片,大多数的西方人(我们从ID和评论的字里行间可以判断)知道那只是部分的或者几年前中国.有很多作出评论的西方人目前住在中国,他们为中国说了实话.让我惊讶的是,一些中国血统的人(因为我不了解他们现在是什么国籍)却在反对这些西方人.

贴几张代表性的图片:(点击放大)

这张照片很明显是10年前的,看到黑板上的日期了么?10年中中国的变化美国人无法了解.

**在你看了那些照片之后,我们来看一些维护中国的西方人的评论:**

> If you think that&#8217;s what all China really looks like you&#8217;re a complete fool. If you think there&#8217;s not a single place in the U.S. where \`blogid\`=379 AND people live in similar economical characteristics, you&#8217;re kidding yourself. Go to some of the poorer neighbors of Louisiana, Alabama or Texas and you&#8217;ll see that your two-car, three-bedroom-house dream isn&#8217;t lived by everyone in the world, let alone your own country. Again, this isn&#8217;t the real China. This is complete bullshit. And stupidverizon is an unsensitive asshole.

> **(截至本文发表被digg 52次)**

> People are so ignorant of China. I lived there for several years. Yes, they have population controls, but the poorest people do not follow them. The nanny that we had while I was there had 5 children, and another on the way. There is a GIGANTIC poverty problem in China. Most of China DOES look like this. The cities are heavily industrializing, but as in most countries, a majority of the people do not live in the largest cities. Also, as for environment, it was one of the most hilarious things. When the UN inspectors came in to do their annual pollution assessment of Beijing while I was there, almost all of the poorest people had to go without power. Thats right, the government TURNED OFF all of the coal power plants, which turned the skies an eerie blue color which I had not seen for the previous year through the normal shade of brown to brown grey.
> 
> Despite that, China was one of my favorite places to live. The people are great, and the culture is pretty cool as well. The government, that is another story. It was hilarious watching these &#8220;apartment maintenance&#8221; people come and change the &#8220;batteries&#8221; on out smoke detectors every couple of weeks. We just knew not to talk about anything sensitive while near the &#8220;smoke detectors&#8221;.

> I just stayed with a family in China for two weeks, plus traveling around the country after that. I can tell you from personal experience that this is nowhere near an accurate representation of China as a whole. Granted, these pictures are all real and don&#8217;t surprise me, but an incorrect picture is being painted here.
> 
> I&#8217;m not discounting this article or calling it fake, just want to throw in that for the most part China is a very different place then what these pictures show.

**嗯,再来看看鄙视中国政府&#8221;专制&#8221;的.**

> &#8220;We&#8217;re sorry. These photos have been removed.&#8221;
  
> -China

**一些中国人的评论:**

> 反对维护中国的评论 
> 
> It&#8217;s not that hard to believe since the Western part of China has always been neglected. Historically China did not include parts of the west and development is heavily concentrated along the coast and northern/central China. I know there are a lot of Chinese apologists trying to make excuses about the pictures and explaining that&#8217;s not all of China. That&#8217;s definitely true but it is also true in certain parts of China. Being originally a southern Chinese, I know there are people who are less fortunate than my family, who by Americans standards were pretty damn poor. Stop making excuses and trying to save face and do something about your own countrymen. One of the tragedies of Chinese progress is that now you have people who are rich enough to pay $300,000 USD for a license plate because it has lucky numbers and at the same time you have the situation we see in the pictures. That cannot possibly be good for a country.

> I was born in a small city in China (Hefei for those who care). Half of my relatives still live in the countryside. I visit them every few years.
> 
> I can tell you that at least half of the pictures are accurate, however, they made it into black and white (or color saturated) to create a dramatic affect. If they were colored, it wouldn&#8217;t look so depressing. Many of the later pictures are depictions of tragedies. While I do agree they occur quiet often in China, majority of the population does not experience it. So I buried this as inaccurate.

> 可能是中国留学生的评论:
> 
> It is not real China.
> 
> I come from China and has been live in US for 3 years.
> 
> People live in Western country need to understand China has 1.3 billion people. China has to grow with its own way. The modified Communism might be the best way for now.
> 
> For the pictures, it is true. However personally I only saw less than 10% of these pictures in the real world in China for my life. It is not real China!

> 本贴中最长的一段评论,来自中国:
> 
> Sorry for the long post, but as I started to write, more and more things came back to me. It&#8217;s a little bit here an there, and some parts might not make much sense to some of you. But just hang in there with me! Thanks.
> 
> I was born and raised in China. After seeing some of the pictures and comments, I felt pretty moved and decided to register just to post a comment.
> 
> I would like to thank everyone for their sympathy, and appreciate all the things you have said. The kindness to help or sympathize is what make US a great nation and what modern China lacks right now.
> 
> I would consider all the picture to be real. Time is irrelevant. Even if only one part of China suffers like some images you saw, that does not mean the issue should be ignored.
> 
> Here is a list, my list, of critical issues China is facing today.
  
> 1. Pollution of industrialized areas
  
> 2. Exponentially increasing gap between rich and poor
  
> 3. Depleting natural resources
  
> 4. Lack of education in rural areas, and lack of proper education for those in the city.
  
> 5. Uneven distribution of wealth. (70% of wealth found on east of china)
  
> 6. (for you singles out there, male to female ratio in younger generation breaching 1.2 last year. in other words, for every 100 girls, there are 120 boys, so 20 will be left out a marriage life. not good for sustainable growth. not a good sign for the us men. )
> 
> And if you look closely to all the pictures, they can all be summed up by the issues above. Some of you might notice that I left population out. If anything, population is China&#8217;s only advantage. Human resource is what has being driving foreign investment for the past 2 decades. And the one-child policy is doing what it can to curb and adjust the population in city areas, but in villages far away from direct central government jurisdiction, the impact is minimum and people will be having more babies. Usually around 3 to 6. Unfortunately, the more poor you are, the more babies you have. The more babies you have the more poor you are. It s a vicious cycle.
> 
> Personally, I have experience similar things like the barber shop. While the one I used to go to at least had some lighting in it, the pictures here bring back memories. The street doctors do give out good massages, they have no license so its usually the neighbors going to them. I always bought baked yams from some of the farmers where they are baked inside wasted oil barrels. And morning rush hour is a pain in the butt, actually, any time on the road is a pain in the butt with all the people. We slept in the streets on summer nights. Not that we didn&#8217;t have anywhere to sleep. It just that we didn&#8217;t want to waste money buying AC, or microwave, TV, DVD player, computer for that matter.
> 
> Yes the life living in China is hard to imagine with Hummers and Limos around here in the US, but I managed to get by and so did everyone else. To throw in a little economics, wants and needs are different from the expectations in US. I need food, water, and a sustainable income, that is all. To be quite honest, people in the US are making way too big of a deal about liberty and freedom. Yes, it is essential; yes, it perhaps is a man&#8217;s birthright. But look at the pictures people! Being able to speak my mind and oppose the local government is last thing I would ever want to do, when I don&#8217;t even know how to feed my family tonight. All your concern for humanity rights is well appreciated, but it doesn&#8217;t help in the realistic version of life.
> 
> Chinese are notorious for enduring hardships and sticking it through. That is why Friday nights at local universities, you will find the Chinese still working in the PC labs (same goes out for a lot of other international students.) Please don&#8217;t compare anything with ABC (american born chinese) friends you might know. If anything, they are too far removed of knowing the history their grand parents experienced.
> 
> No matter what China&#8217;s issues are right now. I would be glad, because at least they have food, at least they are shelter. This is the great progres they made from the 60 and 70. For example in the 60-70&#8217;s for comparison, (WARNING Following might be disturbing content, skip paragraph) If you were to ask my parents, they grew up in times that they had friends who resorted to eat the so-called &#8220;Guanyin Soil&#8221;. Guanyin is a famous Buddha, known for kindness. This soil is pretty much dirty. People were so hungry and isolated at the time, some would eat dirty from the ground. It was enough to satisfy the urge for hunger, but in the following days the person would no doubt die. You can say it was a method of suicide, and dying with a full stomach. Because, suicide seemed to some to be such a kindness as suppose what they had to live through. Finally earning the name of Guanyin Soil. (End warning).
> 
> China is a developing country, some parts of if show greatness surpassing the ranks of London and New York, other parts of it show chaos of that seen in Iraq or typical 3rd world countries. It is a placed mixed with hope and hopeless. But at least now there is hope, something that the country has not seen for too long. If these pictures have moved you, thank the poster, and I hope it will change your thought of human and our endurance to life, and change your view to the world in general.
